### Portfolio built with React and Materialize CSS - in progress.

### Hi, I'm Hannah! Software Developer ready to collaborate and build great products.

### Visit: https://runhannah.github.io/react-portfolio/

I'm an enthusiastic lifelong learner who transitioned from a
career in public policy and budget analysis to software
development to solve problems through technology. I value
curiosity, effective communication, and building products and
features on both the front and back-end of the stack!

I recently completed a full-time software development program and
bring an eye for detail, critical thinking, and perseverance to
find the right solution. I remain upbeat under high pressure and
changing environments, skilled in juggling competing priorities,
and practice strong interpersonal skills.

Becoming a developer has changed how I interact with technology
and how I experience my daily life. I'm ready to leverage my
skills to help find solutions and improve user experiences.

I'm actively seeking Front-End opportunities in Portland, OR, Los Angeles, or San Francisco!
